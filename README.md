# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine if Vine members would be more apt to give a favorable review
We used Pyspark to perform the ETL process, while using an AWS RDS instance to load the data.
The dataset chosen for my project was one on US reviews for video games

With the data collected and shown in the various images, we can see that the percentage of 5 star reviews from Vine users was 51%, while the non-Vine users was only at 39% It could be said that the Vine users although with less reviews, were more apt to give the video game a 5 star review.
to further exemplofy this point, we could use the data to find the mean, median, and mode to truly determine how more likely the Vine users were to give higher rated reviews over the non-Vine users.
